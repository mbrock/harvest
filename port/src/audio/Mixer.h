// The port's mixer: the part of OpenAL the original audio backend used, rebuilt on a miniaudio
// playback device. Sources play whole decoded buffers or streamed queues, and are positioned,
// attenuated and panned the way OpenAL Soft rendered them to stereo. See docs/port/audio.md.
//
// Threads: the game thread changes sources and the listener while holding the mixer lock (MixerLock);
// miniaudio's device callback takes the same lock for each block it mixes. Streamed data is decoded
// on the game thread (periodicStreamUpdate), so the callback only reads memory.
